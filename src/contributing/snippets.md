## User Snippets

Snippets can also be added manually by the user, allowing users to add them on a per-Schoolbox basis. Create a snippet, following [this format](https://gist.github.com/42Willow/4555f0d8fdf8e59b479fd44539740937) and then share it with your friends! These snippets are able to be removed by the user after installation.

Make sure to include the `css` comments

- Do not use quotation marks
- Make sure it is spelt correctly
- Leave a trailing newline character

```css
/* name: Hide PFP */
/* description: Hide your profile picture across Schoolbox */
```
